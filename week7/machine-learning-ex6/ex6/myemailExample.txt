In an effort to continually improve your experience with Indiegogo, we’ve made some changes to our Terms of Use, and wanted to let you know. While we encourage you to review them fully, this email highlights some of the key updates that we have made.


In the updated Terms of Use, which are effective as of December 7, 2016, we have amended some of the existing terms, for example:

We updated information about recovering Campaign funds, including the right to attempt to recover or hold Campaign funds, and the right to use third party collections agencies;
We updated information about Campaign Owner responsibilities, including requirements to: (1) provide frequent updates, (2) certify that the physical location of the Campaign Owner matches the legal residence submitted to Indiegogo, and (3) fulfill any outstanding Campaigns prior to the creation of any new Campaigns;
We reiterated our policy that the Campaign Owner shall be the sole Campaign funds recipient (Indiegogo will not be required to distribute Campaign funds to third parties);
We clarified our policy on the use of Indiegogo’s registered trademarks
By continuing to use the Indiegogo platform, you agree to our updated Terms of Use. If you do not wish to have the new Terms of Use apply to you, you may delete your account.


Thanks for being a part of the Indiegogo Community - we value your role in bringing amazing projects from concept to market.
